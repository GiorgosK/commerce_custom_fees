## Drupal example custom fees

Adds a fee when order includes a custom manual method with id `cod`.  Need to be created seperately. Can be used as an alternative for the yet to be released Drupal 8 commerce_fee module.  When https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_fee is fully supported this might be obsolete but serves also as an example on how to add custom line items to orders.
